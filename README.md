# diabetes_prediction_by-using-support-vector-classifier
## Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. It utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and includes data preprocessing steps such as standardization using the Standard Scaler.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from 'diabetes_data.csv'. It contains information about different health parameters and whether an individual has diabetes or not.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:
bash
https://github.com/abhinavv0111/diabetes_prediction_by-using-support-vector-classifier/new/main?readme=1
This will preprocess the data, train the SVM classifier, and evaluate the model on both training and test datasets.
Data Preprocessing

The data is standardized using the Standard Scaler to bring all features to a common scale.
Model Training

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with a linear kernel is used for training.
Evaluation

The model is evaluated on both training and test datasets using accuracy scores.
Results

Training Data Accuracy:78% 
Test Data Accuracy:77%
